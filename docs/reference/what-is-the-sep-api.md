# What is the SEP API?

The SEP API is an unofficial API for the [Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). The official SEP website is scraped
periodically, and access its entries' contents is provided through a modern
RESTful API.

The current (and temporary) base URL for the API is:

- [https://s-xhpd.onrender.com/api/v1/](https://s-xhpd.onrender.com/api/v1/)
